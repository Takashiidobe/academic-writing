= Roth Conversion Ladders
<roth-conversion-ladders>
A Roth conversion ladder allows you to withdraw your contributions from
your tax advantaged accounts like a 401k without penalty before reaching
the age of 59 1/2.

You have 3 choices of investment accounts:

+ Traditional 401k (not taxed on deposit, taxed on withdrawal)
+ Roth 401k (taxed on deposit, not on withdrawal)
+ Brokerage (taxed on deposit + taxed on withdrawal)

The 401k accounts are better, but they have an early withdrawal penalty;
if you try to withdraw 401ks before 59 1/2, youâ€™ll have to pay tax on
10% of the withdrawals.

The Roth conversion ladder allows one to get around that restriction.
You would deposit money into a 401k and then convert that money into a
Roth IRA, paying your tax during the conversion. Afterwards, you can
withdraw your conversion in 5 years.

So, you convert your yearly spend 5 years before you need to withdraw
it, and you can withdraw it tax free.
